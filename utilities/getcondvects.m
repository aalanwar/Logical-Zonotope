function [condvects] = getcondvects(i)
    % GETCONDVECTS returns a matrix of binary condition vectors.
    % GETCONDVECTS(I) returns a matrix of all possible binary condition
    % vectors for a logical system with (I) inputs.
    % INPUT: (I) shall be an integer >= 1
    % OUTPUT: CONDVECTS is a binary matrix of size [2^I,I]
    % METHOD: The method uses three nested FOR loops that work to target
    % only those cells whose value should be true (which of course is 50%
    % of the matrix).  Therefore, the algorithm scales as [0.5*i*2^i]
    % which is optimal.  Furthermore, the algorithm has low memory
    % footprint and overhead.
